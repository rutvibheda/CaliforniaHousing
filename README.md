In this project, the initial phase involves a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, followed by the basic analysis of the data. Subsequently, the dataset undergoes necessary transformations to ensure its suitability for model training. The core of the project revolves around the training of the model, a pivotal stage where the system learns and adapts based on the provided data. Once the model is trained, a detailed evaluation of its performance metrics is conducted to gauge its effectiveness and accuracy. This project uses Linear Regression.

Moving forward, the model's capabilities are put to the test through the prediction of new data, providing insights into its generalization and predictive abilities. As a crucial step towards future usability, the model file is then pickled at the conclusion of the project, preserving its trained state for future deployment or analysis.
